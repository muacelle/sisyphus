# Sisyphus' Chore
> ***"One must imagine Sisyphus happy."*** <br> Albert Camus

There are only two certainties in life: death and dirty dishes.

Until death arrives, we are doomed to the eternal repetition of boring tasks: washing clothes, cutting our nails, brushing our cats. Worse than that: we are bound to forget when was the last time we cleaned the inside of the microwave, and wonder if it's time or not. *How long has this washcloth been here in the bathroom? Should I wash it now or would that be a waste of soap and time?*

The feeling that we are forgetting or neglecting our chores brings with it constant anxiety and shame. Above all, it raises the unbearable possibility that we are not in control of our own lives.

Since we can't get rid of our chores, it would be a relief to outsource the mental work of continually remembering how often and in which day we should do what.
